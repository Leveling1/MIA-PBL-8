                Lost on this strange island, I have only this diary to tell the story of our odyssey.
                My name is Jonathan NTIAKA and I was part of an expedition to explore Web Island, a place whose origin
                and secrets nobody knows.

                After battling storms and currents, we lost track of time.
                It was a rough sail that took days and nights, with no sign of land.
                We were alone, at the mercy of the elements, not knowing if we would ever see civilisation again.

                After a thousand dangers and trials, we had finally reached our destination.
                Before our astonished eyes stood an unknown island, absent from any map.
                What secrets did it hold? What wonders or perils awaited us? We had no choice but to land and explore
                this lost world.

                As we explored this mysterious island, we were surprised to meet a couple of people.
                They seemed to come from an unknown civilisation and spoke a language that none of us understood.
                Were they friends or enemies? Allies or rivals? We didn't know how to communicate with them, or what
                they wanted from us.

            <p>Faced with this mysterious people, we had only one option: to learn their language.
                A language as strange as it is ancient, which seemed to hold the secrets of this island.</p>
