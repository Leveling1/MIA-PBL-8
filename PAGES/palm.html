    <h1>THE GREAT TREE</h1>

    <p>When you develop a website, you need many and multiple resources (files, images, sounds, fonts, ...). Not to get
        "lost" with a website and in order to organize it, you will need to arrange and dispose the elements in
        directories with a logical way.</p>
    <div class="titre">
        <p>This is called a <span class="italic">tree structure</span> </p>
    </div>

    <div class="contenu ">
        <p>Each HTML document can actually be referred to as a document tree. We describe the elements in the tree like
            we would describe a family tree. There are ancestors, descendants, parents, children and siblings.

            It is important to understand the document tree because CSS selectors use the document tree.</p>
